  <h1>Pseudo-urls</h1>

  <p>
    The program that listens to debian-l10n-catalan understands pseudo-urls
    in the subject header. The pseudo-urls have to have the following form
  </p>
  
<!--<center><code>[&lt;state&gt;]&nbsp;&lt;type&gt;://&lt;name&gt;</code></center>-->
  <center>
    <code>[(ITT|RFR|RFR2|LCFC|BTS#&lt;bugnr&gt;)]&nbsp;(po-debconf|po|debian-installer|man|wml)://&lt;name&gt;</code>
  </center>

  <p>
    The <i>state</i> (between square brackets) can be one of the following:
    ITT,RFR,RFR2,LCFC or BTS.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>ITT (Intent To Translate)<br />
      <ul>
        <li>
	  Sent to indicate that you plan to work on the translation, used to
	  avoid double work
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>RFR (Request For Review)
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Initial translation is done and, attached to the mail, others on
	  the list can then go over it to check for errors
	</li>
	<li>
	  Possibly followed by a RFR2 when substantial changes have been made
	</li>
	<li>
	  NOTE: send a reply if you checked it and found no flaws
	</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>ITR (Intent To Review)
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Meaning "Intent To Review"
	</li>
	<li>
	  Used to avoid LCFC's being sent when there are pending reviews out.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Mainly used when you expect your review not to be ready for several
	  days (because the translation is big, or you don't have any time
	  before the weekend, ...)
	</li>
	<li>
	  Mail body should contain an indication of when to expect the review
	</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>LCFC (Last Chance For Comment)
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Indicates that translation is done, change from the review process
	  have been incorporated, and translation will be send to the
	  appropriate place
	</li>
	<li>
	  Can be sent when there are no ITR's, discussion following the RFR
	  has ended and it has been 3 days since the RFR
	</li>
	<li>
	  Should not be sent before there has been at least one review
	</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>BTS (Bug Tracking System)
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Used to register a bugnr once you submitted the translation to the
	  BTS.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Every day the l10n-bot will check if an open bug report has been
	  closed.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The <i>type</i> can be po-debconf,debian-installer,po,man or wml. The
    structure of <i>name</i> depends on the chosen type. In principle it's
    just an identifier, but it's strongly recommended to follow the following
    rules.
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li><code>po-debconf://package-name</code></li>
   <li><code>po://package-name/path-in-sourcepackage</code></li>
   <li><code>debian-installer://package-name/path-in-sourcepackage</code></li>
   <li><code>wml://adres_of_webpage</code></li>
   <li><b>Doesn't work yet </b><code>man://package-name/section/subject</code></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you send an LCFC, RFR of RFR2 you should attach the file you want
    reviewed. The file should have the appropriate extension, for the types
    po, po-debconf and debian-installer this <i>po</i>, for the type wml
    <i>wml</i> and for type man I still have to figure it out. The file will
    be put up the website.
  </p>

  <p>
    The state BTS is somewhat special, it used to register a bugnr so the
    l10n-bot can track the status of you're translation once you submitted it
    to the BTS. Every day it will check if any of the open bug reports have
    been closed. An example of this command is:
  </p>

  <center><code>[BTS#1234] po-debconf://cupsys</code></center>

  <p>
    If you have the intent to translate a lot of packages, you can ITT them
    all at ones. An example:
  </p>
  
  <center><code>[ITT] po-debconf://{cupsys,courier,apache}</code></center>

  <p>
    So put the packages between curly braces and separate them with comma's.
    No extra spaces!
